PRoblem Statement:

The NGO wants to start some marketing efforts to increase the donations received from its client base. The NGO does not know which
customers would be willing to pay. Also the NGO does not know how much the client might pay?

Final State: The NGO has a machine learning model which indicates the probabilities of the client responding or not responding back 
to the offers we make. The expected profit is calculated using a confusion matrix and Expected value equation

E() = [p(o1)*v(o1)]+ [p(o2)*v(o2)]+ [p(o3)*v(o3)]+.....+[p(oN)*v(oN)], where N is the total number of outcome variations possible 

Methodology:
Followed the 6 stage framework of CRISP Cross Industry Standard PRocess of DAta mining

1) Business Undersdatning:
The NGO has about 50,000 USD $ set aside for its marketing efforts 
The profit margin from each of the customers is high - Around 2000$
The cost for making the offer and market is also high - Around 100$. Accordingly they have the capabilties to target 50000/100 = 500 customers 
in their list of clientelle.

2) Data understanding:

The data was provided by the NGO itself according to the forms the clientelle had filled up from the past few years.
There were features of the clientelle and also global economic factors included. About 50 features were present in the data.
Both numberic type and categorical type variables were as an input
